**Department Sales Analysis**
**Data Preprocessing:**

Identify and address data quality issues, such as missing values and inconsistencies.

Import the dataset into Tableau Desktop, ensuring that the data types are identified correctly.

**Task 1: Time Series Analysis and Visualization**

Using the provided sales data, create a time series plot to visualize monthly sales over the given period. Discuss any observable seasonal patterns or notable trends.

**Task 2: Comparative Analysis of Sales by Category**

Create a bar chart to visualize total sales for each product category. Then, construct a box plot to compare sales across categories. Discuss top-performing categories and those showing the most sales variability.

**Task 3: Geographic Sales Analysis**

Analyze the sales distribution across different geographic regions using the state information. Develop a heatmap to visualize total sales by state within the U.S. Discuss any regions with particularly high or low sales and hypothesize the reasons behind this.

**Task 4: Customer Segment Analysis**

Create a pie chart to show the proportion of total sales contributed by each customer segment. Additionally, visualize the trend of sales over time for each segment using a line chart. Discuss any insights derived from the sales performance and trends of these customer segments.

**Task 5: Dashboard Design**

Design an interactive dashboard for your visualizations.
